# ASSIGNMENT ON KERNEL MODULES

This aassignments mainly deals with operations performed  with kernel modules.

## Introduction



* In this project, we  will be learning how to create a kernel module and load it into the Linux kernel. We have to use  the terminal application to compile the programs, 
* We will have to enter commands on the command line to manage the modules in the kernel.
* we will discover, the advantage of developing kernel modules is that it is a relatively easy method of interacting with the kernel, thus allowing us  to write programs that directly invoke kernel functions



## Creation of Kernel Modules

The first and primary task is to create and load the kernel module into the kernel.we will be able to list all the kernel module by using the command 

                   lsmod
The command will list  all the kernel modules providing description by three columns that is name , size ,used by
