<h1>ASSIGNMENT ON KERNEL MODULES</h1>
<br></br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project, we  will be learning how to create a kernel module and load it into the Linux kernel. We have to use  the terminal application to compile the programs, and     you will have to enter commands on the command line to manage the modules in the kernel.</p>
</p>we will discover, the advantage of developing kernel modules is that it is a relatively easy method of interacting with the kernel, thus allowing you
to write programs that directly invoke kernel functions</p>
 
<p><b>Any errors in code can any errors in the code could crash the system! However, since we  will be using a virtual machine, any failures will  only require rebooting of the system.</p></b>
